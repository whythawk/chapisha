# Contributing to **chapisha**

We'd love you to support **chapisha**!

## Issues

Questions, feature requests and bug reports are all welcome as 
[discussions or issues](https://github.com/whythawk/chapisha/issues/new/choose).

Please include as much context as possible with your requests so others can replicate your problem, including any
dependencies or data sources.

To report a security vulnerability, please [contact us](https://whythawk.com/index.php/contact-us) so that we can get a fix out
as quickly as possible.

## Pull requests

Before making a pull request, please create an issue to discuss your proposed change.

There are a range of opportunities for getting into contributing, including:

- Expanding the documentation,
- Adding in additional 'action' scripts,
- Refactoring or optimising the code.

Please ensure you run tests locally. **chapisha** tests don't require a database and have few dependencies, so running them
doesn't take long and should be straightforward.

If you add in new features, please also add in tests and documentation.

## Financial support

If you want to support us financially to ensure this project's continuity and development, please
