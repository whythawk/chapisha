  'Years after the events of "Lament for the Fallen", Isaiah tells of the myth of Usan Abasi, who was punished by the Sky God to spend eternity in the form of a brass bowl and imprisoned within a vast termite mountain. Now the ceremony which ensures that Usan Abasi remains dormant has failed, and his ancient evil awakes. A free, stand-alone short-story set in the city of Ewuru and linking "Lament for the Fallen" to a forthcoming novel.'],
